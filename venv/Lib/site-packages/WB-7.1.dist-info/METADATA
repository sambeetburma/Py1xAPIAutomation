WB, the Web Billboard is a CGI program which can be used to manage "billboards",
i.e.: pages where documents can be posted (and edited, and removed) in a simple
way, without the need to know HTML or how to manage a web site. In this respect
it may be considered a very simple form of Content Management System which, in turn,
is very simple to install and configure.

Look for documentation in:

- about.html: a brief review of WB functionalities.

- installation.html: step-by-step installation procedure.

- config.html: directions on how to create your own document repositories.

- usage.html: a short description on how to use WB (i.e.: how to add and modify
              documents to your repository).

- copyright.html: copyright note and disclaimer.

- wbfaq.html: questions and answers (very short, for the moment).
